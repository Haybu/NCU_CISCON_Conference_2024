Health insurance provides important financial protection in case you have an accident or sickness. For example, health insurance may help to pay for doctors\u2019 services, medications, hospital care, and special equipment when someone is sick or injured, often in exchange for a monthly premium. It may help cover a stay at a rehabilitation hospital or even a portion of home health care. Heath insurance can also keep a consumer\u2019s costs down when they are not sick. For example, it can help pay for routine check-ups. Most health insurance also covers many preventive services at no cost, such as immunizations and cancer screening and counseling.\nWhat is a Health Insurance Plan (also called a health plan or policy)?\n\n\n0.4653899073600769\nHealth care coverage is often grouped into two general categories: private and public. The majority of people in the U.S. have private insurance, which they receive through their employer (which may include non-government employers or government employers at the federal, state or local level), buy directly from an insurance company, or buy through a Health Insurance Marketplace\u00ae. 1 Some people have public health care \ncoverage through government programs such as Medicare, Medicaid, or the Veteran\u2019s Health Administration. \nHealth care coverage can also be categorized by the scope of benefits it offers or how long the coverage \nlasts. Health insurance often includes a wide range of covered services, including emergency and non-emergency services as well mental health benefits.
